## Methodological Notes

### Language Coverage Assessment
- **Strong coverage:** English, French sources provided comprehensive perspective diversity
- **Moderate coverage:** Portuguese, Danish sources supplemented regional insights effectively  
- **Limited coverage:** Russian sources available but restricted; Chinese, Arabic, Hindi sources minimal but provided crucial alternative perspectives
- **Recommendation:** Maintain current multilingual approach, prioritizing quality over quantity

### Social Media Validation Effectiveness
- **Reddit/Twitter cross-referencing successfully identified sustained engagement vs. temporary viral content
- **Cultural penetration indicators (memes, symbols, sustained discussion) proved more reliable than traditional media coverage volume
- **Recommendation:** Continue social media validation for cultural significance assessment

### Archive Test Application
- **Successfully filtered daily noise from structural changes
- **10-year memory test effectively identified paradigm shifts vs. incremental developments
- **Temporal bias awareness crucial - some August events may prove less significant in hindsight
- **Recommendation:** Maintain Archive Test as primary significance filter
